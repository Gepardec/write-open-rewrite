# Recipe will change dependency management and dependency usage of querydsl-core dependency in given project
# This order is necessary to preserve the version as property and the separation of dependency management and dependency usage
# Order:
# - Change groupId in dependency management
# - Update version property
# - Change groupId in dependency usage
# Notice: If this recipe runs in dryRun mode it will create some unpleasant comments in pom.xml

# Recipe will change the current Log4j dependency version to the latest release version

displayName: Upgrade Log4j dependency version
description: Upgrades the Log4j dependency to the latest release version
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.logging.log4j.Log4j1ToLog4j2

      #Version 1
      #newVersion: #maybe we could use the oldest version (2.0.2) in core and then call the recipe for updating the log4j dependency?

      #Version 2
      # We may call org.openrewrite.java.logging.log4j.Log4j1ToLog4j2 - which will be even more accurate and
      # after that we may call this org.openrewrite.java.logging.log4j.UpgradeLog4J2DependencyVersion to get the newest version?
